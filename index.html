							<h2>Red Roofed Barn</h2>
							<p>This photo was taken at the Virginia Tech Smithfield Horse Center. I was fascinated with the accents of red in this photo with the entire barn being white and the door and roof being a solid red. The bright and vibrant color of red really stood out against the solid white. I enjoyed how there was a white VT symbol painted on the door which tied the whole thing together.</p>

							<h2>Mountain Tops</h2>
							<p> This photo was taken behind north main street on a very steep road that lead myself to finding the perfect spot to look out over the various mountain tops. My favorite part about this photo is that it represents the beautiful mountains that surround the Virginia Tech campus. This is important to me because even though students get caught up in everything Virginia Tech has to offer, especially me, I am reminded everyday that Blacksburg is a beautiful place to attend school. </p>

							<h2>Fall Leaves</h2>
							<p>This photo was taken in a neighborhood off of south main street. While I was taking this photo I saw children getting off of the bus and running and playing around outside. This photo truly represents fall in my mind when the leaves are beginning to turn orange and the air starts to become crisp. </p>

							<h2>Smithfield Horse Center</h2>
							<p>I took this photo at the Smithfield Horse Center hence the image includes the sign that says Smithfield Horse Center. I used leading lines from the fence to draw the eye towards the sign. I love the lighting in this photo because the top half with the bright blue sky and white puffy clouds is very bright while there is a partial shadow casted on the bottom half from part of a barn onto the fence.</p>

							<h2>Gazebo Outlook</h2>
							<p>This photo was taken at the same place as the mountain tops photo. The girl photographed is my best friend Kyleigh Judson. As you can see through the gazebo are the exact mountain tops photographed in the previous picture. I like this image because it's showing someone else enjoying the view and the setting that they're in not just the view itself.</p>

							<h2>VT Wooden Fence</h2>
							<p>This photo was also taken at the Smithfield Horse Center and is the side to an area that contains hay for the horses. I met a woman at the horse center who told me that Virginia Tech students painted this part of the wooden fence which I thought to be very cool. I love how students turned an ordinary wooden fence into something colorful and school spirited.</p>

							<h2>Fenced in Barn</h2>
							<p>This is a photo of the main barn at the Smithfield Horse Center containing various horse stables as well as an office. I love the horse weathervane on the top of the barn's roof. Although the weathervane is small it's my favorite part about the photo to represent what the barn is used for. </p>

							<h2>Horse & Hay</h2>
							<p>This photo is of a beautiful chesnut colored horse at the Smithfield Horse Center. The horses name is Star and she is feeding on some hay in the fenced in area directly to the left of the main barn. I used to ride horses when I was younger which is why I enjoyed taking the trip over to the horse center to reminisce on my riding days.</p>

							<h2>Duck Pond</h2>
							<p>This photo is of the gazebo at the duck pond where people like to go to watch and feed the ducks. If you look close enough there are two elderly ladies sitting on the right side of the gazebo. I love the arches shown in the photo from the gazebo and the branches of the tree overlapping the roof in the top third of the image.</p>

							<h2>Blue Sky</h2>
							<p>This photo captures the vibrant blue sky as well as the landscape of the Smithfield Horse Center. I angled my camera upwards to be able to have the majority of the image to be the gorgeous and bright blue sky meanwhile, still including everything on the ground in the bottom third. I think the tree in the right half of the image makes it more interesting instead of the entire top two thirds being only of the sky.</p>

							<h2>Greenery</h2>
							<p>This photo was also taken off of north main street at the same location as the previous two photos. This time I wanted to capture what was closer to the eye including all of the different types of greenery. I love how you can see the dark green mountains in the distance and then the trees that are much closer appear to be a brighter green with the grass filling in the rest of the image with a light green.</p>

									<h2>About me</h2>
									<p>Hello! My name is Olivia Merklinger and I am currently a sophomore at Virginia Tech. I am from Virginia Beach, Virginia and have a family of 6. I am the oldest and have two younger sisters and a young brother, as well as a chocolate lab named Bodie. I love to travel, go on hikes, swim in the ocean, and any water activites. I enjoy anything that has to deal with being outdoors which is one of the main reasons I really liked taking photos for this photo gallery.</p>
